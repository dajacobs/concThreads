1. The Thead will implement a Runnable interface. This is done so an instance of Thread is passed to Executor.execute. It does not make sense to use Thread objects this way, especially if the object is directly instantiated from Thread its run method doesn't do anything. You must define a subclass of Thread with a useful run method, but this class would would not be useable by the executor.
